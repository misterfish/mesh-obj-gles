need textures.zip and the .blend (not .obj -- we will export these from
blender to get the full animation sequence).

also ignore the wolf_1, wolf_2 etc. .blend files, which are not necessary.

• animation, apply modifiers, include edges, write normals, include uvs,
write materials, triangulate faces, objects as obj groups

• need to make a file mapping textures to objects (.obj doesn't handle this)



mystery: how to export a non-uniform texture from blender. maybe not
possible.
(there is a file path encoded in the .mtl file, but blender doesn't export
this file; not even sure if it honors the file internally)
