need textures.zip and the .blend (not .obj -- we will export these from
blender to get the full animation sequence).

also ignore the wolf_1, wolf_2 etc. .blend files, which are not necessary.

• animation, apply modifiers, include edges, write normals, include uvs,
write materials, triangulate faces, objects as obj groups

• need to make a file mapping textures to materials (.obj doesn't handle this)




materials can use textures in a number of ways (e.g. map_Kd, map_d, etc.)
we ignore this and simply use the texture as an ordinary image to be drawn
on the polygon (can depend on e.g. decal mode, modulate mode, insofar as
these are still supported by GLES)
